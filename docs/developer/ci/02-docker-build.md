title: Docker build
description: The Dockerfiles, the build script, rolling and release build workflows, and how to build and push manually.
---
GPU CI runs inside `radixark/miles`. This doc maps which Dockerfiles exist, the script that builds them, the PR-side build check, the rolling and versioned release workflows, and manual build and push behavior.

## Dockerfiles


| Path                     | Builds                   | Wired into                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `docker/Dockerfile`      | `radixark/miles` (CUDA)  | `docker-build.yml`, `release-docker.yml` |
| `docker/Dockerfile.rocm` | AMD ROCm (MI35x) | `docker-build.yml` (`rocm*-mi35x` variants) |


### `docker/Dockerfile` — inputs & output

The Dockerfile is the build recipe: it provides the cu13 defaults and emits one image. `build.py` owns the variant → build-arg overrides (see Build script), including the cu12 base and wheels release.

**Inputs (build-args)**

**Output** — one `radixark/miles` image for the platform buildx targets: the SGLang base, then the Python dependencies declared in `requirements.txt`, Megatron-LM at its branch default or caller-pinned commit, Miles, and the prebuilt wheels (`sgl-router` among them). A multi-arch build is one `buildx` run executed once per platform — `TARGETARCH` differs each time, so each arch installs its own wheels — and buildx pushes the two as a single manifest.

`docker/Dockerfile.rocm` is the ROCm counterpart (build-args `GPU_ARCH`, a ROCm `SGLANG_IMAGE_TAG`, and a `WHEELS_TAG_ROCM` release from `XinyuJiangCMU/miles-wheels-rocm`). `rocm720-mi35x` sets `APPLY_ROCR_VMMFIX=1` to install the rebuilt ROCr with the VMM-pause fix from its wheels release; ROCm 10 has the fix upstream. `rocm10-mi35x` uses its own cp312 wheels release (`rocm10-gfx950-v0.5.18`) and sets `APEX_USE_PREBUILT=1` and `NVRX_INSTALL=1`.

## Build script

`docker/build.py` builds and pushes the images. Select a build with `--variant` and a tag mode with `--image-tag {dev,latest,custom}`. The `VARIANTS` table is the source of truth for each variant's image, target platforms, Dockerfile, and default build-args. Repeatable `--build-arg KEY=VALUE` options are appended after those defaults, so an explicit caller override wins.


| `--variant`    | Tag (`--image-tag dev`)            | Platforms                     | Notes                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `cu13`         | `radixark/miles:dev`               | `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` | **multi-arch**, one manifest — the daily image |
| `cu13-x86`     | `radixark/miles:dev`               | `linux/amd64`                 | x86-only build of the same image               |
| `cu13-aarch64` | `radixark/miles:dev`               | `linux/arm64`                 | arm64-only build of the same image             |
| `cu12-x86`     | `radixark/miles:dev-cu12`          | `linux/amd64`                 | CUDA 12.9 legacy                               |
| `rocm720-mi35x` | `rocm/sgl-dev:miles-rocm720-mi35x` | native                       | AMD MI35x (`gfx950`, ROCm 7.2) — `docker/Dockerfile.rocm` |
| `rocm10-mi35x`  | `rocm/sgl-dev:miles-rocm10-mi35x`  | native                       | AMD MI35x (`gfx950`, ROCm 10, py3.12 base, ROCm SDK as pip wheels) — `docker/Dockerfile.rocm` |


The cu13 variants share one multi-arch CUDA base image and differ only in platforms. `cu13` runs a single `buildx --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` — buildx builds both arches and pushes them as one manifest in a single shot, with the Dockerfile picking each layer's wheels by `TARGETARCH` (see Dockerfile inputs), so `docker pull` auto-selects by host arch.

The **Tag** column is for `--image-tag dev`, which also pushes a timestamped `dev-<YYYYMMDDHHMM>` sibling; `latest` swaps the prefix to `latest`, `custom` uses `--custom-tag`. `cu13` / `cu13-x86` / `cu13-aarch64` intentionally share `radixark/miles:dev` — the daily build runs `cu13` (multi-arch), while a single-arch variant overwrites `dev` with one arch when run alone.

A multi-arch build (`cu13`) needs Buildx's `docker-container` driver. Use `--push` to publish directly, or `--output type=oci,dest=/tmp/image,tar=false` to export a local OCI layout for later publication; it cannot load into the local image store. Use `cu13-x86` / `cu13-aarch64` (single-platform; the arm64 one cross-builds via QEMU on an x86 host) for local single-arch iteration. Other flags: `--push`, `--dry-run`, `--dockerfile`, `--custom-tag`, and repeatable `--build-arg KEY=VALUE`. `--context <repository>` selects a separate build context while keeping the driver and hash reader in their original checkout.

## PR build check (in `pr-test.yml`)

Dockerfile changes can be build-tested on the PR itself, before merge, by selecting CUDA tests, for example with `run-ci-image`. A Dockerfile change alone does not request GPU execution or a PR image build.

`pr-test.yml` calls `_build-pr-ci-image.yml` only when its final stage selection contains CUDA tests and `stage-a-cpu` satisfies its success/bypass gate. CPU-only PRs skip both the build call and its downstream `resolve-ci-image`. Both CPU stages run without waiting for images. An eligible PR keeps **one** image tag, `radixark/miles:pr-<num>`, for its whole life, and rebuilds it only when the content that feeds it changes:

| Job | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `docker-decide` | hashes the build inputs (`docker/image_inputs.py`) and compares. Inputs equal to the base branch → no PR image, suites run on `dev`. Otherwise it reads the `miles.image-inputs` label off the published `pr-<num>` tag: same hash → reuse it, different or absent → rebuild. Forks inspect the public tag without repository secrets |
| `docker-build` | builds `cu13` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and pushes `pr-<num>`, stamped with the inputs hash. Same-repository rebuilds use a `docker-build` node. Fork rebuilds wait on a hosted runner for `Build Fork CI Image` to return success; otherwise this job is a hosted-runner no-op |
| `resolve-ci-image` | resolves the CI image to `pr-<num>` whenever that tag is current — whether this run built it or an earlier one did — so **every GPU suite runs inside the PR's image**; a failed build stops the matrix instead of testing a stale image. A PR image outranks a `ci-image-tag:` PR-body directive, which applies only when the PR has no image (PRs whose image inputs match the base) |
| `delete-pr-tag` (`docker-pr-tag-cleanup.yml`) | removes the `pr-<num>` tag when the PR closes; the tag stays available for re-runs while the PR is open |

So a rerun, or a push that touches only source files, reuses the image the PR already has instead of rebuilding an identical one. Non-docker PRs are untouched: no PR image, matrix on `dev`, as before.

`docker/image_inputs.py` is the single source of truth for what counts as an input (`docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/build.py`, `docker/install-kube-tools.sh`, `docker/verify_transformer_engine.py`, `docker/patch/**`, `requirements.txt`). `Dockerfile.rocm` is deliberately excluded — it feeds the `rocm/sgl-dev` images, not the `cu13` image built here.

To rebuild an eligible PR image when its inputs did not change — a moved base image, a floating dependency, a corrupt push — add the **`rebuild-ci-image`** label alongside a CUDA test request. The label does not select tests or make a PR whose build inputs match the base eligible. Once consumed by a build, it is removed so later runs can reuse the image.

### Fork PR publication

Fork `pull_request` runs do not receive Docker Hub secrets. Their image job uses the same CUDA selection, CPU A success/bypass gate, hash decision, and output contract as same-repository PRs. When a rebuild is needed, it submits an attempt-bound request and waits for trusted publication. Success continues to `resolve-ci-image` and GPU tests in the same CI attempt; a publication failure fails the image job. CPU tests are not rerun.

`build-fork-ci-image.yml` starts on `PR Test`'s `workflow_run.in_progress` event and waits for the request artifact, which is readable before the source run finishes. Only a request allocates a builder. The caller waits for the matching publisher run and its build job to succeed, so an existing tag cannot satisfy a forced rebuild prematurely. The hosted handoff has a 360-minute limit covering queue and build time; the builder retains its 180-minute limit.

The trusted workflow binds the request to its source run and attempt, the open fork PR and current head, the latest matching PR Test run, and the original merge SHA recorded by GitHub for `_build-pr-ci-image.yml`. It resolves selection and fast-fail policy from the request's original PR-event labels, matching the caller even after labels are removed. These labels are policy input from the source workflow, not proof of publishing authority; credential isolation is described below. It checks the CPU gate, including successful jobs retained by partial reruns, and uses trusted code to parse the PR's test registrations without importing them. A later main advance does not change the frozen merge.

Host orchestration comes from the default branch. Only the fork Dockerfile and build context enter an isolated BuildKit instance, with no secret forwarding or insecure entitlements. Both architectures are exported as a local OCI layout. BuildKit is removed before Docker Hub login; the publisher copies the layout to the fixed `pr-<num>` tag without running the image and verifies both architectures' inputs hashes. Fork edits to the host build driver, hash reader, or workflow take effect after merge.

A new request cancels an older build for the same PR. During building, the trusted helper checks every 30 seconds that the source attempt remains active and stops its build process group if it ends or is superseded. The publisher rechecks the live PR and source before publication. Builder and local-output cleanup also run on failure or cancellation. A forced build consumes its original one-shot label, with the same removal-failure warning as same-repository builds.

This path requires `build-fork-ci-image.yml` and its trusted helpers on the default branch. It cannot complete while introduced only on a PR branch. Existing `Approve Trusted CI` handles GitHub's contributor approval hold independently.

## Rolling Docker build (`docker-build.yml`)

This workflow owns the rolling `dev` and `latest` image families. It has two jobs:

- **`check-upstream`** (schedule / `simulate_schedule` only) — polls the inputs the image bakes: the HEAD SHA of sglang `sglang-miles` (`sgl-project/sglang`) and Megatron-LM `miles-main` (`radixark/Megatron-LM`) — the source branches it builds — plus a fingerprint of the selected `yueming-yuan/miles-wheels` rolling release, so a rebuilt sgl-router or other wheel also triggers a build (re-uploads to the same tag are caught by fingerprint, not commit SHA). It compares against the values cached from the last build and sets `should_build=true` if any moved. `miles` itself is intentionally not polled — that would rebuild far too often. This is what stops the 12-hour cron from rebuilding an unchanged image, with one staleness bound: because the image also bakes a `miles` checkout, `should_build` is forced to `true` once the last triggered build is **24h** old, so `dev` never drifts more than a day behind the `miles` repo even when sglang / Megatron / wheels are quiet. (The cache file's last line records the epoch of the last triggered build; it is only re-saved when a build fires.)
- **`build-and-push`** (self-hosted `docker-build` runner) — calls `docker/build.py` to build + push, then conditionally points `latest` at the new `dev` and prunes old timestamped tags.

`build-and-push` runs when `check-upstream` was skipped, or ran and reported `should_build=true`.

### Triggers: automatic vs manual

- **Automatic** (no human) — the **schedule** (cron 00:00 / 12:00 UTC, gated by `check-upstream`) and any **push to `main` that touches `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/install-kube-tools.sh`, `docker/verify_transformer_engine.py`, or `requirements.txt`**. Both leave `--variant` empty and build **two images**: `cu13` → `radixark/miles` (multi-arch) and `cu12-x86` → `radixark/miles:dev-cu12`.
- **Manual** — `workflow_dispatch` (pick one variant — see Trigger a build yourself below) or running `docker/build.py` locally. Only the `rocm*-mi35x` images have **no automatic path in this repo** (their nightlies live in sgl-project/sglang) (`cu13-x86` / `cu13-aarch64` just rebuild the same `dev` image single-arch).

`docker/build.py` and `docker/patch/**` participate in PR image validation but are not `main`-push triggers; [Release a Version](/developer/ci/04-release) treats them as manual preflight cases.


| Trigger                                     | `check-upstream`                   | builds                | `latest` move     | prune      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| schedule (cron 00:00 / 12:00 UTC)           | runs; build if upstream moved or last build ≥ 24h ago | `cu13` + `cu12-x86`   | yes (both)        | yes (both) |
| push to `main` touching `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/install-kube-tools.sh`, `docker/verify_transformer_engine.py`, or `requirements.txt` | skipped                            | `cu13` + `cu12-x86`   | no                | no         |
| `workflow_dispatch`                         | skipped                            | the one input variant | no                | no         |
| `workflow_dispatch` + `simulate_schedule`   | runs                               | the one input variant | no                | no         |


### Tags & where it pushes

All images push to **Docker Hub**. CUDA variants → `radixark/miles`; ROCm variants → `rocm/sgl-dev` (a separate namespace). The tag a build writes depends only on `--image-tag` and the variant's postfix:

| variant(s) | `--image-tag dev` writes | `latest` mode writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cu13` / `cu13-x86` / `cu13-aarch64` | `radixark/miles:dev` + `radixark/miles:dev-<YYYYMMDDHHMM>` | `radixark/miles:latest` |
| `cu12-x86` | `radixark/miles:dev-cu12` (+ timestamped sibling) | `radixark/miles:latest-cu12` |
| `rocm720-mi35x` / `rocm10-mi35x` | `rocm/sgl-dev:miles-rocm*-mi35x` (+ timestamped sibling) | `rocm/sgl-dev:latest-rocm*-mi35x` |

What **moves a shared tag**: `--image-tag dev` overwrites `:dev` (or `:dev-cu12`) and adds a timestamped sibling; on a **scheduled** run `latest`→`dev` *and* `latest-cu12`→`dev-cu12` both advance; pruning likewise runs **only on schedule**, keeping the newest 20 of **each** series — `dev-<ts>` and `dev-cu12-<ts>` independently. Any `workflow_dispatch` — **including** `simulate_schedule` — writes its own tag(s) but never moves `latest` or prunes; only the real cron mutates published tags. See the trigger table above.

### Trigger a build yourself

Manual builds run through `workflow_dispatch` — by default the image is built straight from the inputs you pass; with `simulate_schedule`, `check-upstream` runs first for signal but does not gate the manual build (see the `workflow_dispatch` rows in the table above for how this differs from schedule). Start one two ways:

- **Web UI** — Actions → "Docker Build & Push" → **Run workflow**, then fill the inputs below.
- **CLI** — `gh` dispatches on the repo's default branch; pass `--ref <branch>` to build another branch's workflow.

```bash
gh workflow run docker-build.yml -f variant=cu13 -f image_tag=dev
# custom tag instead of dev/latest:
gh workflow run docker-build.yml -f variant=cu13-x86 -f image_tag=custom -f custom_tag=my-tag
```

| input | required | values / default |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `variant` | yes | `cu13` / `cu13-x86` / `cu13-aarch64` / `cu12-x86` / `rocm720-mi35x` / `rocm10-mi35x` |
| `image_tag` | yes | `dev` / `latest` / `custom` |
| `custom_tag` | no | tag name; required when `image_tag=custom` |
| `dockerfile` | no | path to Dockerfile (default `docker/Dockerfile`) |
| `simulate_schedule` | no | `true` runs the `check-upstream` poll first (default `false`) |

### Steps (`build-and-push`)

1. checkout → Buildx → install Python + typer → Docker Hub login.
2. **Build + push** via `build.py` — automatic runs build **both** `cu13` and `cu12-x86`; a manual dispatch builds only the one variant you picked.
3. **schedule only** — point `latest`→`dev` and `latest-cu12`→`dev-cu12`.
4. **schedule only** — prune each timestamp series to the newest 20.

### Push auth & permissions

Pushes use a Docker Hub credential, not your identity:

- **Remote (CI)** — the workflow logs in with repo secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, so you don't hold the key — you just trigger the run, which needs repo **Write** access. No approval gate, but `build-and-push` runs on a `self-hosted` runner, so it only fires when one is online.
- **Local** — `build.py --push` uses your own `docker login`; you need push rights to the target namespace (`radixark/miles`, or `rocm/sgl-dev` for ROCm).

## Versioned release build (`release-docker.yml`)

`release-docker.yml` checks out the supplied release ref, requires its committed `release-lock.json`, and passes the locked SGLang and Megatron-LM commits plus the checked-out Miles SHA as final `--build-arg` overrides. Rolling `docker-build.yml` keeps the branch defaults. Published tags and the guarded dispatch and retry procedure are documented in [Release a Version](/developer/ci/04-release).

## Image retention (open)

`docker-build.yml` prunes `dev-<timestamp>` and `dev-cu12-<timestamp>` as separate series, keeping the newest 20 of each; `dev` / `latest` and `dev-cu12` / `latest-cu12` move forward. Ordinary PR, nightly, and weekly CI therefore has no durable image record. A release branch cut instead retags the newest timestamped `dev` image, or mutable `dev` when none exists, as prune-exempt `release-vX.Y.Z-ci` and records that tag in `release-lock.json`. The guarded preflight is documented in [Release a Version](/developer/ci/04-release).
