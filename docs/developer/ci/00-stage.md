title: Stage
description: How CI stages are defined, how a test's suite maps to a stage, and what each stage does.
---
A *stage* is one CI job in a Miles CI workflow. A *suite* is the `suite=` value a test declares in `register_*_ci(...)`. Stage names and suite names are the same set, mapped **1:1**: a test runs in exactly the stage whose name equals its `suite`.

## Suite → stage mapping

The canonical suite list is `CI_SUITES` in `tests/ci/run_suite.py`, grouped by hardware backend (CPU / CUDA / ROCm). Cadence does not change this inventory: regular, nightly, weekly, and release runs use the same stages. Every CPU and CUDA entry has one matching job in `pr-test.yml`; `stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` has its matching job in `pr-test-rocm.yml`; the `nightly-` prefixed MI350 suites are owned by the external nightly described below. A test picks its stage purely by `suite=`; the stage job runs `run_suite.py --suite <name>`, which collects exactly the tests carrying that suite.

The mapping is kept in sync by hand on both sides:
- A `suite=` with no matching job never runs.
- A stage job whose suite no test uses runs zero tests and exits 0 (intended during incremental migration).

Stage names follow `stage-<tier>-<gpus>-<hw>` (or `stage-<tier>-<hw>` for CPU, e.g. `stage-a-cpu`): `tier ∈ {a, b, c}` classifies cost/role, `gpus` is the GPU count the test needs, `hw ∈ {cpu, h100, h200, b200, mi350}` is the hardware class. A `nightly-` prefix marks a suite that only the external MI350 nightly schedules, keeping its registrations in a separate namespace from the ones this repository's own workflows consume.

## Stage roster

| Stage / suite | Hardware | Runner labels (`runs_on`) | Shards | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stage-a-cpu` | GitHub-hosted CPU | — (`ubuntu-latest`) | 4 | `resolve-ci-policy` |
| `stage-b-cpu` | GitHub-hosted CPU | — (`ubuntu-latest`) | 1 | `resolve-ci-policy` |
| `stage-b-2-gpu-h200` | 2× H200 | `["h200","2gpu"]` | 1 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-2-gpu-h200` | 2× H200 | `["h200","2gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-4-gpu-h200` | 4× H200 | `["h200","4gpu"]` | 3 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-8-gpu-h100` | 8× H100 | `["h100","8gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-8-gpu-h200` | 8× H200 | `["h200","8gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-8-gpu-b200` | 8× B200 | `["b200","8gpu"]` | 1 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` | 4× MI350 | `["self-hosted","amd","mi350","4gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers |
| `nightly-stage-c-2-gpu-mi350` | 2× MI350 | external nightly | — | — |
| `nightly-stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` | 4× MI350 | external nightly | — | — |
| `nightly-stage-c-8-gpu-mi350` | 8× MI350 | external nightly | — | — |

`stage-c-8-gpu-b200` is the only Blackwell stage: the Blackwell fleet is a single unpartitioned host, and an 8-GPU runner cannot share a node with 2/4-GPU runners without both claiming the same physical GPUs. Blackwell tests needing fewer than eight GPUs therefore register against this suite too and leave the surplus idle, which is correct because a test declares its own GPU budget (`ray start --num-gpus`, `torchrun --nproc-per-node`) rather than inferring one from the devices it can see.

In `pr-test.yml`, `tier a` (CPU fast) gates PR-image preparation and the NVIDIA GPU fleet; its GPU stages (`b` / `c`) all depend on both resolvers and `stage-a-cpu`, and run concurrently with each other — the `b` / `c` letters classify role, they are not a sequential pipeline. The MI350 stage has no CPU-test gate.

`pr-test.yml` treats `pull_request.closed` as cancellation-only: the close event shares the PR's concurrency group, cancels any queued or running `PR Test` run, and starts no resolver or test jobs.

Both PR workflows are also reusable `workflow_call` entry points for release CI. Called runs group concurrency by `inputs.ref`, so redispatching the same release branch cancels the older run; literal `pr-test-` and `pr-test-rocm-` prefixes keep the CUDA and ROCm groups from cancelling each other under the same branch-cut caller.

## What each stage does

**Image resolution (`resolve-ci-image`).** In `pr-test.yml`, a small `ubuntu-latest` job selects, in order: the called workflow's `image_tag`, the `ci_image_tag` dispatch input, a current `pr-<num>` image, the PR description's `ci-image-tag:`, then `dev`. It validates the result is a bare tag and outputs `radixark/miles:<tag>`. `release-branch-cut.yml` passes the prune-exempt `release-vX.Y.Z-ci` tag recorded in `release-lock.json`.

The ROCm resolver uses only its dispatch input, defaults to its undated `rocm/sgl-dev` tag, and uses that default for called release runs too. For PRs, it runs only when `stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` is selected. CPU-only PRs skip both CUDA image preparation and ROCm image resolution.

Distinct from image selection, the **`run-ci-image` label** selects the test scope — every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long` — which validates an image bump without selecting those domains implicitly.

**Policy resolution (`resolve-ci-policy`).**

- `pull_request`, `schedule`, and `workflow_dispatch` only say how the workflow started; none itself implies a cadence or domain scope.
- Each Miles PR workflow passes trigger facts and, for PRs, the diff to `tests/ci/ci_policy.py`, which publishes the resolved policy and `skipped_stages` for `run_suite.py` and GPU job gates. `needs_cuda_image` derives from that selection and gates CUDA image preparation.
- A PR `nightly` label maps to nightly cadence.
- A scheduled run maps its exact UTC `github.event.schedule` cron: `0 15 * * 0-5` maps to nightly and `0 15 * * 6` maps to weekly; an unknown cron fails.
- A manual dispatch keeps regular cadence and has no PR labels. Both GPU workflows add `--match-all-labels` so an explicit manual operation runs the full regular GPU suites; CPU selection remains unchanged.
- A reusable `workflow_call` supplies an explicit cadence override because the called workflow inherits the caller's event name. Policy resolution deliberately runs the caller commit's `ci_policy.py`; only suite jobs check out the requested release ref.

A **nightly** policy selects every enabled tag except `long` and `ft-long`, admits both regular and `nightly=True` registrations, and disables fast-fail. **Weekly** and **release** select every enabled tag, admit both registration types, and disable fast-fail; release differs by never writing the rolling performance baseline. Regular cadence admits only regular registrations. All four cadences use the same stage inventory.

`run-ci-all` selects the full domain-tag set without changing cadence. `run-ci-image` selects every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long`. If scope signals overlap, the precedence is `run-ci-all` > weekly/release full scope > nightly > `run-ci-image`. The resolved cadence and raw/synthetic labels are passed to `run_suite.py`, which computes one run policy (see [Labels](/developer/ci/01-label) for the subtraction semantics).

**PR GPU stage selection.** Before runner allocation, PR GPU stages are filtered by `runnable ∩ affected`: `runnable` reuses cadence/label selection, while `affected` maps changed registered tests to their suites. Known non-GPU paths affect none; unknown, missing, or malformed diffs affect all. `nightly`, `run-ci-all`, and `run-ci-image` add their runnable stages; `bypass-fastfail` does not. CPU stages and scheduled/manual runs are not filtered.

**Dependencies / gating.** In `pr-test.yml`, both CPU stages require only `resolve-ci-policy`. PR-image preparation requires selected CUDA tests and the `stage-a-cpu` success/bypass gate; NVIDIA GPU stages follow image resolution. `stage-b-cpu` stays parallel and does not gate that chain. Resolved nightly, weekly, or release cadence and the `bypass-fastfail` PR label admit the chain after an actual `stage-a-cpu` failure and make each suite continue after a test failure. This fast-fail exception does not itself select GPU tests or bypass policy or Docker/image failure; cadence and labels determine selection as described above. Scheduled, manual, and called release runs retain their existing image preparation.

**Runner selection.** CUDA stages request runners by label via `runs_on`, a JSON list passed through to `runs-on` — a runner must carry **all** listed labels (GPU class + count). CPU stages call `_run-cpu-ci.yml`, whose only job runs on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest`, so they don't occupy GPU-fleet slots.

**Arch dispatch.** `tests/ci/hardware.py::CUDA_STAGES` is the single source of truth for the CUDA taxonomy: each stage's GPU generation, GPU count, and runner labels. `CI_SUITES` and the `/rerun-test` runner map both derive from it, and a stage's `--suite` already names its generation, so no job passes an arch explicitly.

A test normally runs at its home stage. A [dispatch label](/developer/ci/01-label) can send it to another generation instead, in which case the destination is the smallest stage on that generation with enough GPUs — a test declares its own GPU budget through `ray start --num-gpus` / `torchrun --nproc-per-node` rather than reading the devices it can see, so a wider stage simply leaves the surplus idle. Today every dispatched test lands on `stage-c-8-gpu-b200`, the only Blackwell stage; partitioning a second Blackwell host adds narrower stages and routing follows automatically.

Without a dispatch label nothing leaves its home stage, so scheduled and called runs are unaffected. Whatever stage actually executes a run is also the stage its performance baseline is keyed on, keeping the generations' numbers apart.

**Dependency boundary.** CUDA stages start from dependencies baked into `radixark/miles`, reconcile Miles runtime dependencies from `requirements.txt`, update the SGLang and Megatron-LM checkouts to the selected refs, and expose all three source trees through `PYTHONPATH`; they do not rebuild or install the Miles, SGLang, or Megatron-LM source trees after the container starts. The hosted CPU stages install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and the fully pinned `tests/ci/requirements-ci-cpu.txt`, then expose the Miles, SGLang, and Megatron-LM source trees through `PYTHONPATH` without editable installs or inline package lists. The ROCm stage instead uses the SGLang and Megatron-LM versions baked into `rocm/sgl-dev`, unless the run names a ref for either.

CUDA and CPU dependency refs resolve in this order: explicit dispatch input or PR-body directive, committed `release-lock.json`, then the moving `sglang-miles` / `miles-main` branch heads. A called release run therefore checks out its requested Miles `ref` and consumes the lockfile on that ref unless an explicit override exists. ROCm checks out the requested Miles ref but keeps the dependencies baked into its image unless the run names a ref for one.

**Launch.** Each CPU/CUDA stage is a thin caller of one hardware-specific reusable workflow: CPU stages use `_run-cpu-ci.yml`, while CUDA stages use `_run-ci.yml`. Each reusable workflow declares only its matching job, so GitHub does not add a skipped CPU sibling to CUDA stages or a skipped CUDA sibling to CPU stages.

Both workflows receive `execute_command` and an optional `ref`; CUDA callers additionally pass `runs_on` and `container_image`. The reusable workflows own checkout, runner setup, dependency and source resolution, and the two command invocations (first `--list-only`, then the real run); each stage owns only which runner class, image, ref, and command to select.

**Secrets.** CPU/CUDA stages call their reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`. The ROCm caller passes `WANDB_API_KEY` explicitly; GitHub withholds it from fork `pull_request` runs.

**Sharding.** A stage with a `partition_id` matrix splits its tests across N shards; `run_suite.py` balances the shards by each test's `est_time`. Each shard is an independent job instance running the same `execute_command` with a different `--auto-partition-id`.

Weekly runs keep the same shards but set each GPU matrix's `max-parallel` to one, so each stage occupies at most one matching runner. Stages remain independent: `stage-b-2-gpu-h200` and `stage-c-2-gpu-h200` may each occupy one 2-GPU runner at the same time. PR, nightly, and release runs retain their existing matrix parallelism.

## ROCm PR/nightly/weekly/release mirror

`pr-test-rocm.yml` exposes `pull_request`, exact nightly and weekly crons, `workflow_dispatch`, and `workflow_call`. PR runs use the same low-trust merge-commit model as `pr-test.yml`. It runs `stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` through `_run-ci-rocm.yml` on two 4-GPU MI350 runners and splits tests into two `est_time`-balanced shards; weekly alone limits the matrix to one runner at a time. It runs no CPU tests.

A called release run checks out the supplied Miles `ref` with `cadence=release` but resolves the same undated `rocm/sgl-dev:miles-rocm720-mi35x` image as the other automatic paths. SGLang and Megatron-LM remain baked into that image, so release ROCm is a smoke signal.

Only tests registered with `register_rocm_ci(suite="stage-c-4-gpu-mi350", ...)` run; the `nightly-` prefixed suites and CUDA registrations are not inherited. PR, nightly, weekly, and release runs consume the shared cadence and label policy: `run-ci-amd` selects the `amd`-labelled subset, other `run-ci-*` labels select matching subsets, nightly admits regular plus `nightly=True` registrations, and weekly or release selects every enabled registration.

Manual dispatch adds `--match-all-labels` and runs the full regular 4-GPU suite. The external nightly coverage of all three prefixed MI350 suites is described below.

Fork PRs use GitHub's standard `pull_request` protections: checkout tests the merge commit, repository secrets are withheld, and held runs follow the shared maintainer approval flow described in [`01-label.md`](01-label.md).

An 8-GPU CUDA case needs a separate 4-GPU `test_amd_<name>.py` variant rather than an `IS_HIP` branch in the original test.

Both runner containers can see all eight host GPUs through `/dev/dri`. Each runner restricts itself to four GPUs with `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, which `_run-ci-rocm.yml` forwards into the container.

**External MI350 nightly.** Miles declares `nightly-stage-c-2-gpu-mi350`, `nightly-stage-c-4-gpu-mi350`, and `nightly-stage-c-8-gpu-mi350` in `CI_SUITES` for the external nightly, and keeps the unprefixed `stage-c-4-gpu-mi350` for its own `pr-test-rocm.yml`. The three prefixed suites are run by the external [`sgl-project/sglang` ROCm 10 nightly workflow](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly-test-amd-miles-rocm10.yml).

## Assumptions

- Suite-to-stage mappings are maintained manually across `run_suite.py`, the Miles workflows, and the external MI350 nightly workflow.
- Runner placement assumes the live fleet actually carries the requested `runs_on` labels for each GPU class and count.
- `est_time` only affects shard balancing and per-file timeout, never pass/fail.
